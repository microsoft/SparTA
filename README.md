# SparTA

> *This repo is current an **alpha** version and under active development. We're trying to make it stable and user-friendly, but it is not surprising to meet problems in current phase. Please open issue or contact the authors when you need help.*

`SparTA` is an end-to-end system to harvest the speeding up gain from the model sparsity.

## Installation 
SparTA depends on user's local CUDA environments. Here are some requirements
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [PyCuda](https://pypi.org/project/pycuda/)

Please make sure that the CUDA version matches the version used to compile PyTorch binaries.

User could install through `pip` command as below (*The PyPI install path is coming soon*)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/SparTA.git
```
or
```bash
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/SparTA.git
pip install -e SparTA
```

## Usage

### Tune a sparse operator

```python
import torch
import sparta.nn as snn
from sparta.testing import rand_block_mask
M, N, K = 1024, 1024, 1024
X = torch.rand((M,K))
linear_op = torch.nn.Linear(K, N)
w_mask = rand_block_mask(sparsity)
sparse_linear_op = snn.SparseLinear(linear_op, weight_mask = w_mask)
best_config = sparse_linear_op.tune()
Y = sparse_linear_op(X)
```
